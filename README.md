# Discord Bot Online Tool
## A Super Simple Discord Bot Host Tool

### What is this
Discord Bot Online Tool is a Java-based application that allows users to run and manage Discord bots easily.
It provides a simple command-line interface to start, stop, and manage your Discord bot without the need for manual command prompt interactions.


### What can this do
Start and manage your Discord bot with ease.
Ability to automatically save and load your bot's token for convenience.
Graceful shutdown of the bot to ensure a clean exit.


### What else do I need
[Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](https://www.java.com/zh-TW/download/manual.jsp) version 8 or above is required to run the Discord Bot Online Tool.


### How can I install this
download the zip file and unarchive it (everywhere you want!)
run the start.bat 
and a little cute black console window should pop up
first, it will ask for your discord BOT token
all you need to do is just copy it from [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and paste it in
now, bot should work perfectly


### Anything else
there are several commands you can use in the console
`stop` stop the bot and turn off the console
`logout` logout from current BOT and you can log into another BOT you want


### Where can I contribute
